					<p>According to Survey Approximately 17-20k deaths annually caused by malaria. This is most death taking disease in
                        the south africa and near by countries. As there is no vaccine is available till now that will protect us from malaria
                        but some genral precaustion can protect us. Most of the death causes in this disease are due to unable to detect malaria
                        using the CNN with blood sample image we can easily detect the infection in blood and the model that we use to do this is 
                        known as VGG16 model that gives us 94% accurate  results

                        
                    </p>
                    <p>We have to just feed the image of blood samples and AI will tell you are infected or not along with the seviour ness</p>
