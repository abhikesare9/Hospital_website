					<p>Covid-19 is one of the most dangerous virus from 2020. It has taken more than 19crore deaths across the worlds
                        there is no such a accurate way to detect the covid virus as it has very common characterstics like fever and cold
                        so scientist has developed way to dectect the covid-19 virus with the help of x-ray of chest. And Data scientist came
                        up with another method that will work on the basis of x-ray. Using the CNN(convulutional neural network) we can detect 
                        virus from the image of x-ray and that has accuracy about 96% which far more and better than human accuracy.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>We have to just feed the image of x-ray and AI will tell you are infected or not along with the seviour ness</p>
